=Powerstop
Background process, which stops all applications on another workspace and resumes them, when returning to that workspace.
Pinned applications are ignored.

Depends on libwnck.

== TODO
Depend on state of power manager (plugged/unplugged). Probably best by starting and stopping the app with powerstate change. (DBUS signal?)
