consistency:
    # List of one or more consistency checks to run: "repository", "archives", and/or
    # "extract". Defaults to "repository" and "archives". Set to "disabled" to disable

    # "archive" checks all of the archives, and "extract" does an extraction dry-run
    # of just the most recent archive.
    checks:
        - repository
        - archives
