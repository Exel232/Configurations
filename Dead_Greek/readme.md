= Dead Greek Letters using xmodmap

Adding greek input in X is really easy, once you know how it can be done. X supports a dead-greek mode natively.

Adding a dead_greek symbol to a key is enough to enable greek letter input.

Using xmodmap, we can for example use altgr-g as dead_greek modifier to enter greek symbols.
